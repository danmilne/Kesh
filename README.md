Kesh Regular
========
_by [Emily Floyd](http://workingmodeloftheworld.com/Emily-Floyd) and [Dan Milne](http://typelab.co)_

Kesh Regular was created by artist Emily Floyd in collaboration with Dan Milne from Typelab. The font is a specially designed typeface for Ursula K. Leguin's invented Kesh language. Kesh Regular is an open source font resource. 

Kesh Regular was produced for the occasion of the exhibition *A Working Model of the World*.


GLYPH SET
--------
The glyph set of Kesh Regular is based upon hand drawn glyphs in the appendix of Ursula Le Guin's *Always Coming Home*. It comprises a lowercase alphabet, assorted ligatures and punctuation.

USING KESH REGULAR
--------
Kesh Regular works best in OpenType-savvy applications with the OpenType Ligature feature switched on to allow automatic substitutions. Kesh words spelled phonetically in the Latin script are converted automatically into the Kesh script.

Substitutions include:
--------
UPPERCASE TO LOWERCASE  //  
The Kesh script is lowercase only however the font has been made so that input text can be upper- or lowercase or a combination. When the Ligature feature is switched on, uppercase letters are automatically converted to lowercase.

LIGATURES AND DOUBLE-LETTERS  //  
The Kesh script includes a number of sounds such as 'ai', 'sh', 'hw' and 'ch' which are represented as combined letters in the latin script. In addition, the Kesh script represents double-letters by adding a double-letter accent (a small arc shape above). These sounds and double-letters are handled as ligatures in the Kesh Regular font, automatically substituted when the Ligature feature is on.

ACUTE ACCENTS  //  
The Kesh alphabet includes three sounds which are represented using acute accents in the latin script ( í ó ú ). These must be inserted manually by typing or via a layout interface such as the Glyph palette in InDesign.
